# fingerprint-identification
A c++ code for identifying and veryfying a fingerprint image among others in a folder. It was written some years ago and uploaded by 2019. 
What the code does: There are several fingerprints, about 100, in a folder. And the program takes in all and saves their minutiea or unique features in the memory. Then a user choses one fingerprint as input so the system extracts its minutieas and match it to the ones in the memory and identifies the fingerprint.
