# fingerprint-identification

What the code does: There are several fingerprints, about 100, in a folder. And the program takes in all and saves their minutiea or unique features in the memory. Then a user choses one fingerprint as input so the system extracts its minutieas and match it to the ones in the memory and identifies the fingerprint.
